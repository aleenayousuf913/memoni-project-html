Check out my website at memoniproject.com

In partnership with Living Tongues Insitute for Endangered Languages, I created the first-ever dictionary for an endangered language, Memoni, and coded this webstie to preserve the language for future generations. The file containing my website's code is attached to this repository. I apologize for not splitting the code up into separate files; I just uploaded a file of the completed code and it came up as one HTML file. Feel free to copy-paste the code and input your own data to create your very own dictionary!
